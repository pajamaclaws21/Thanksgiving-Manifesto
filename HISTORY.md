"Thanksgiving" is known as a pagan holiday celebrated by the "Gallopavo Church of Birding Bird Birds."
Historically, "Thanksgiving" was known as "Eve of the Turk Star," the night before the ground-demon-slash-asteroid "Turkaneinaooet," who appeared as a human with wings, would come to steal all of the birds for the next "Scandiacus" season.
Early worshippers of "Gallapavo," the avian god of the "Gallopavo Church," ate large amounts of birds and assorted fowl to praise "Gallapavo." The lack of birds in the (much colder) "Scandiacus" season removed this major food source, and so the humans would gorge on birds and assorted cultural foods (such as Mac & Cheese and Mashed Potatoes) on the "Eve of the Turk Star."
Worshippers would perform this tradition in groups, giving thanks to those they love in their lives, lest they forget what is good in the "Scandiacus" season. 

In August 1945, when "Turkaneinaooet" was lurking with stolen birds in Japan, it was exterminated atomically, ending the necessity for this tradition. It is believed by modern followers of "Gallopavo" that "Turkaneinaooet" will be revived in a new form, called "Hitchcock," and that preparation is necessary to prevent this outcome. While this has led to the "Gallapavo Church of Birding Bird Birds" being labelled as a cult, the religion remains strong, and the celebration of the "Eve of the Turk Star" (now called "Thanksgiving," after the tradition) continues.

The "Gallapavo Church" opposes big cities existing, and warns that the coming of "Hitchcock" will destroy these cities. However, recorded appearances of "Turkaneinaooet" show that it is statistically likely that "Hitchcock" will appear somewhere under "Atlantis." Some members of the "Gallapavo Church" do not preach this tale, and instead oppose skyscrapes, because of the mass numbers of birds that run into them and are subsequently killed anually.

The sacred texts of the "Gallapavo Church," including the middle school diary of "Turkaneinaooet" and tales about how the stars and humanity were made by "Gallapavo," reveal that the idea of "Hitchcock" is fairly recent. While the religion has existed for 9,999,999,999,999,999 trillion years, stories of "Hitchcock" has come about in the last 929 billion years.
